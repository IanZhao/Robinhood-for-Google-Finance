# Robinhood for Google Finance

A Python script to export your [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com) trades to a .csv file (In a nice, Google Finance friendly format).  Based on the [Robinhood library by Rohan Pai](https://github.com/Jamonek/Robinhood) and [Robinhood to CSV by Josh Fraser](https://github.com/joshfraser).
Works on Python 2.7+ and 3.5+

###Install:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

###Run:
    python gf-export.py

I've added the orginal script by josh which is useful in the way of getting more information than normally possible.  This will eventually be changed to be more helpful by correcting a few of the original issues, but for now is a good start to get some useful debug information.  If you have any issues please run this script as well, and if possible send the results of gf-export.py and debug.py to me with a small description on the issue at hand.

###Debug:
    python debug.py
